<h3>editgroup</h3>

<p>The editgroup program edits an entry in groups.txt in the system folder. It requires multiple arguments to get anything useful done.</p>

<p>The first argument must be the id of the group you want to edit. This is a string which starts with a g and continues with numbers.</p>

<p>The remainder of the arguments are pairs, the first of which specifies an option and the second of which specifies the new value for that option.</p>

<p>In short, the syntax looks like:</p>

<code>./editgroup [id] -n [new name] -ping [ping setting] -l [log setting] -page [page assignment] -e [responsible person's email]</code>

<p>Be sure to put quotes around any arguments (name, page) that contain spaces. The ping and log settings may only be 0 or 1. 0 turns off pinging or logging while 1 turns it on.</p>

<p>Changing the name of a group also causes all target references to it in targets.txt to change. If you change the page assignment, the new page must already exist.</p>
