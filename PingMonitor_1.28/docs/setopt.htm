<h3>setopt</h3>

<p>The setopt program allows you to set the various user-settable options in settings_system.txt in the system folder. The program takes pairs of arguments which are the names of settings, and the new values for those settings.</p>

<p>As of this writing (version 1.26) there are only three settable options. EmailFrom sets the from address of emails sent by the system. EmailSubject sets the subject of the same emails. ReportFolder allows you to relocate the reports folder to somewhere other than the usual place, perhaps on a web server.</p>

<code>./setopt EmailFrom [from address] EmailSubject [email subject] ReportFolder [folder path]</code>

<p>You can set more than one option at once, by using more than one pair of arguments. Be sure to enclose any arguments that contain spaces in quotes.</p>
