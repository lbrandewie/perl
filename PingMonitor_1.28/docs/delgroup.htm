<h3>delgroup</h3>

<p>The delgroup program deletes an entry from groups.txt in the system folder. It takes only one argument, which can be either the name or id of a group to be deleted.</p>

<p>Group ids are strings which start with a g and are followed by numbers. Each group has one. If the argument you provide looks like a group id (it's a g followed by only numbers) it will be assumed to be one; otherwise it will be assumed to be a group name.</p>

<p>A group cannot be deleted if it has targets assigned to it. However, it can be renamed (see <a href='editgroup.htm'>editgroup</a>).</p>
