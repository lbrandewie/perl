<h3>addgroup</h3>

<p>The addgroup program adds a group to the groups.txt file in the system folder. There are two syntaxes, first the compact:</p>

<code>./addgroup [name of group] [ping setting] [log setting] [page assignement] [email of responsible person]</code>

<p>Or, the verbose:</p>

<code>./addgroup -n [name of group] -ping [ping setting] -l [log setting] -page [page assignment] -e [email of RP]</code>

<p>For either syntax, the ping and log settings must be either 0 or 1. 0 turns pinging or logging off, while 1 turns it on.</p>

<p>If the group name or page contain spaces, be sure to put quotes around them. The order of the arguments is not important in the verbose syntax; it is in the compact syntax.</p>

<p>The page you are assigning the group to must already exist.</p>
