<h3>delpage</h3>

<p>The delpage program deletes an entry from pages.txt in the system folder. It takes only one argument, which must be either the name or id of a page to delete.</p>

<p>If the argument looks like a page id (it's a p followed only by digits) it will be assumed to be one, otherwise it will be assumed to be a page name.</p>

<p>A page cannot be deleted if it has groups assigned to it. But, it can be renamed (see <a href='editpage.htm'>editpage</a>).</p>
